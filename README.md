In this Project we have made efforts to make an algorithimic trading stratergy which is mainly for mid and long term investments by the use of Fundamental Analysis in collaboration with Machine learning techniques like LSTM after a comprehensive experimentation with Models like Linear Regression, RNNs and Bidirectional LSTMs.

Linear_regression_to_predict_stock_price.ipynb has Linear Regression to predict stock prices with transformation and regularization.

Stock_price_prediction_using_RNN.ipynb has RNN using dropout and optimizer with 3 layers of RNN to predict the stock price.

Algorithmic_Trading.ipynb which uses 3 layers of LSTM with dropout and optimizer to predict stock prices.

Conclusion:- LSTM better than RNN and linear regression.
